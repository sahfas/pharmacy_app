## Setting Up

change the database setting in the .env file and you are ready to go

## User Types

My system has 2 user types
    - pharmacist
    - user

When we register the the dealut user type will be user.

When you login as user you cann see all the funstionalities of user

If you want to see functionalities of a pharmacist you have to change the user_type in the databse manually as pharmacist and come to the system you can check the funstionalities of pharmacist.
